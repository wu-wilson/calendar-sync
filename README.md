# **Calendar Sync**

This repository contains the frontend and backend for **_Calendar Sync_**, a web app I created to familiarize myself with full stack development.

Calendar Sync is a productivity website that creates a shared calendar. In the shared calendar, users can quickly add and delete To-Do items. Calendar Sync is designed for groups, so the calendar and to-do list are updated in real-time.

### **Running the Web App**

This web app is currently not deployed. If you want to run Calendar Sync locally, you should clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies. Otherwise, you can just check out the YouTube demo I've made below!
